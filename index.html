<h2>Three benefits using IOT</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Efficient Water Management:</li>
    <p>IoT-based sensors monitor soil moisture and weather conditions in real time, ensuring that water is used only when needed, reducing wastage.</p>
    <li>Remote Monitoring & Automation:</li>
    <p>Farmers can control irrigation systems remotely using mobile apps or cloud platforms, allowing them to adjust schedules and optimize water usage without being physically present.</p>
    <li>Cost & Resource Savings:</li>
    <p>By preventing over-irrigation and reducing manual labor, IoT helps lower water bills, electricity costs, and operational expenses, making farming more sustainable and profitable</p>
</ul>
